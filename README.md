# My Phase-1 Project
# PodJourney

## Description

This project demonstrates the skills and concepts learned in **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** through the development of a web application called **PodJourney**.  

**PodJourney** is a simple, elegant single-page application that allows users to **search and discover podcasts** using the **iTunes Search API**.  
The application showcases the use of **API integration**, **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **local storage** in real-world scenarios.  

The user interface is designed using a **purple, pink, and blue** theme to provide a visually appealing and modern experience across devices.

## Features

In this project, the following features have been implemented:

1. **Podcast Search**  
   Users can search for podcasts by entering a title, keyword, or category in the search bar. The app fetches and displays results directly from the iTunes Search API.

2. **Podcast Details**  
   For each podcast displayed, the app shows the **cover art**, **description**, and **release date**, helping users learn more about each show.

3. **Search History**  
   The app uses the browser’s **Local Storage** to keep a record of recent search terms, allowing users to easily revisit past searches.

4. **Responsive Design**  
   The layout automatically adjusts to fit both desktop and mobile screens, ensuring an optimal user experience on all devices.
