   For each podcast displayed, the app shows the **cover art**, **description**, and **release date**, helping users learn more about each show.

3. **Search History**  
   The app uses the browser’s **Local Storage** to keep a record of recent search terms, allowing users to easily revisit past searches.

4. **Responsive Design**  
   The layout automatically adjusts to fit both desktop and mobile screens, ensuring an optimal user experience on all devices.
